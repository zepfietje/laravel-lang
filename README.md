# Laravel Lang

This repository contains translations for the language files shipped with Laravel.  
Both the language and code style are followed as closely as possible.

## Installation

For now, language files have to be manually copied from the `src` folder of this repository to your Laravel project.

## Languages

To guarantee quality, only Dutch (nl) translations are included at the moment.  
Feel free to contribute any other languages or improvements.

## Version

Translations are kept up to date with the English (en) language files in the [Laravel repository](https://github.com/laravel/laravel).  
Currently, Laravel Lang reflects [this version](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/tree/db596ba02aaedd925be3dd3c51d486355da277db/resources/lang).

## Starware

Laravel Lang is Starware.  
This means you're free to use the project, as long as you star its GitHub repository.  
Your appreciation makes us grow and glow up. ⭐
